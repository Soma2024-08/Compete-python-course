# 💰 Simple Expense Tracker

A basic personal finance management tool implemented in Python. This program allows users to track their expenses, view a list of all recorded expenses, and calculate their total spending.

## ✨ Features

* **Add Expense:** Record new expenses with details including **date**, **category**, **description**, and **amount**.
* **View Expenses:** Display a clean list of all entered expenses.
* **Total Spending:** Calculate and show the aggregate sum of all recorded expense amounts.
* **Exit Gracefully:** Quit the program cleanly.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

The entire program is built using only fundamental Python concepts, as per the specified constraints:
* **Loops** (`while`, `for`)
* **Conditional Statements** (`if-elif-else`)
* **Data Structures** (`list` to hold all expenses, and `dictionary` for each individual expense record).

No user-defined functions, classes, or file handling are used.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Save the Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `expense_tracker.py`).
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Run the program using the Python interpreter:
    ```bash
